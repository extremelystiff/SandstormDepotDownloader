# Sandstorm Depot Downloader

This tool is for Insurgency: Sandstorm, despite a lot of the naming scheme around this. This tool is origianlly made for Terraria by RussDev7. I will leave his readme here as the tool hasn't changed, just what game its downloading.

TerrariaDepotDownloader - Downgrade your game to any of the past game versions where the steam manifest IDs are known.

## How It Works
Steam allows the downloading of previous game versions through the use of depots. Depots are a collection of files pertaining to a group; for steam, the game Terraria. When a game gets updated, steam archives each patch as something called a manifest ID. Using steam console and the correct manifest ID, you can downgrade/download any game version that you own on your account. Using an open source utility called DepotDownloader, you can download depots with a lot more flexibility.

Included in this application's directory is a file named ManifestVersions.cfg. This file is in charge of all the game versions and their data which is loaded into the program. This can be updated to include future versions or previously unknown earlier versions of the game without the need to download a new tool version.

Note to Terraria's team: I have created this courtesyware in hopes to diminish pirating and bring easability to downgrading. If their is any issues with this tool please do not hessitate to contact me.
